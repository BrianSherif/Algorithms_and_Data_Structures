A greedy algorithm decides the "best choice" at depending on the variables present at the moment.
This could lead to a global optimum (tho not guaranteed).
However in this case, since we start from the top of the triangle; there is no "best choice".
We must try different combinations of paths, because we can never tell wether the correct decision was made
since we can't see beyond our current position in the triangle.
